## Prerequisites
- Python 3


##Setup

1. Create a virtual environment with `pyvenv env` (unless you're installing it outside the folder, please name the environment folder "env")
2. `pip install -r requirements`
3. Create a new settings file in `tag_site/settings/`, you can copy the `template.py` file* 
4. In your project's root, type the following:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

After that you should be able to view the site in the browser at `http://localhost:8000`

*If you're running locally, name it `local.py`, otherwise you'll need to create an `environment.py` file in root and change the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable
